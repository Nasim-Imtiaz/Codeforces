First we have to find how many flagstones we need to pave height & weight.
If flastone size is equal to height or weight that mod number of flastone is needed.
If flagstone size is greater than height or weight then mod result will be increased by 1.
Then multiply the two mode result.
Note that, though the limit for m,n & a is in integer limit we have to multiply to we must need to use long long to get the accurate result.
